Our goal is to provide a collection of rich, high-performance libraries to process data at scale. We are currently building these tools to work with Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Active Projects\r\nWe are building a set of scalable, high-performance libraries that address an array of data processing concerns such as data quality assurance, data preparation for machine learning, data anonymization and data security. Here is a list of currently active projects \r\n* **prep-buddy** - A Scala / Java / Python library for cleansing, transforming and preparing large datasets for ML operations on Apache Spark.\r\n* **protectr** - A Scala / Java / Python library for anonymization, encryption and redaction operations for large datasets on Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCatch up with us at our google group data-commons-toolchain@googlegroups.com\r\n",
